A dialog is a popup UI element that contains a header, body and footer, each containing specific types of sub-components. Dialogs also have an instance API and several configuration options, including configurable callback functions for certain dialog events.

== Use cases

=== Display basic information

The link:code.html[`+code+`] plugin's dialog is an example of a simple dialog. It contains only one body panel component that displays the HTML code from the content.

=== Display complex information

More complex dialogs can use link:dialog-components.html#tabpanel[tab panels] and various link:dialog-components.html#layoutcomponents[layouts] to categorise and organise information displayed to the user. For example, the link:help.html[`+help+`] and link:charmap.html[`+character map+`] plugins use dialogs with tabbed panels to categorise and separate information.

=== Interactive dialogs

{productname} dialogs can also contain link:dialog-components.html#basiccomponents[interactive components] such as buttons, checkboxes and input fields.

For example, the link:image.html[`+image+`] plugin's dialog allows for users to link to or upload an image, input a description, title, class, caption, height and width, then insert it into the editor.

== Body components

The body of a dialog must be either a link:dialog-components.html#panel[`+panel+`] (a single panel) or a link:dialog-components.html#tabpanel[`+tabpanel+`] (a collection of panels). Each panel can contain link:dialog-components.html#panelcomponents[panel components] such as inputs, buttons and text.

=== Panel

The basic dialog type is a *panel* dialog. A panel is a container for link:dialog-components.html#panelcomponents[panel components]. A panel type dialog only has one panel.

----
{
  type: 'panel',
  items: [ ... ] // array of panel components
}
----

=== TabPanel

A *tabpanel* dialog contains multiple panels, and a tab navigation menu on the left-hand side of the dialog to allow for switching between panels. Each panel can contain different link:dialog-components.html#panelcomponents[panel components], allowing for complex dialogs.

See the link:dialog-components.html#tabpanel[tab panel component reference] for tab panel configuration options.

[source,js]
----
{
  type: 'tabpanel',
  tabs: [ // array of tab panel specifications
    {
      name: 'mytab',
      title: 'My Tab',
      items: [ ... ] // array of panel components
    },
    ...
  ]
}
----

The `+name+` of the panel can be used with the link:dialog-apis.html#dialogapimethods[`+dialogApi.showTab('tabName')+`] method to programmatically switch tabs. It is also passed to link:dialog-configuration.html#configurationoptions[`+onTabChange+`] as part of the `+details+` object.

==== Example tab panel

The Help plugin's dialog is an example of a tab panel dialog.
