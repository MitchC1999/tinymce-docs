A dialog is a popup UI element that contains a header, body and footer, each containing specific types of sub-components. Dialogs also have an instance API and several configuration options, including configurable callback functions for certain dialog events.

== Use cases

=== Display basic information

The link:{baseurl}/plugins-ref/opensource/code/[`+code+`] plugin's dialog is an example of a simple dialog. It contains only one body panel component that displays the HTML code from the content.

=== Display complex information

More complex dialogs can use link:{baseurl}/how-to-guides/creating-custom-ui-components/dialogs/dialog-components/#tabpanel[tab panels] and various link:{baseurl}/how-to-guides/creating-custom-ui-components/dialogs/dialog-components/#layoutcomponents[layouts] to categorise and organise information displayed to the user. For example, the link:{baseurl}/plugins-ref/opensource/help/[`+help+`] and link:{baseurl}/plugins-ref/opensource/charmap/[`+character map+`] plugins use dialogs with tabbed panels to categorise and separate information.

=== Interactive dialogs

\{\{site.productname}} dialogs can also contain link:{baseurl}/how-to-guides/creating-custom-ui-components/dialogs/dialog-components/#basiccomponents[interactive components] such as buttons, checkboxes and input fields.

For example, the link:{baseurl}/plugins-ref/opensource/image/[`+image+`] plugin's dialog allows for users to link to or upload an image, input a description, title, class, caption, height and width, then insert it into the editor.

== Body components

The body of a dialog must be either a link:{baseurl}/how-to-guides/creating-custom-ui-components/dialogs/dialog-components/#panel[`+panel+`] (a single panel) or a link:{baseurl}/how-to-guides/creating-custom-ui-components/dialogs/dialog-components/#tabpanel[`+tabpanel+`] (a collection of panels). Each panel can contain link:{baseurl}/how-to-guides/creating-custom-ui-components/dialogs/dialog-components/#panelcomponents[panel components] such as inputs, buttons and text.

=== Panel

The basic dialog type is a *panel* dialog. A panel is a container for link:{baseurl}/how-to-guides/creating-custom-ui-components/dialogs/dialog-components/#panelcomponents[panel components]. A panel type dialog only has one panel.

[source,js]
----
{
  type: 'panel',
  items: [ ... ] // array of panel components
}
----

=== TabPanel

A *tabpanel* dialog contains multiple panels, and a tab navigation menu on the left-hand side of the dialog to allow for switching between panels. Each panel can contain different link:{baseurl}/how-to-guides/creating-custom-ui-components/dialogs/dialog-components/#panelcomponents[panel components], allowing for complex dialogs.

See the link:{baseurl}/how-to-guides/creating-custom-ui-components/dialogs/dialog-components/#tabpanel[tab panel component reference] for tab panel configuration options.

[source,js]
----
{
  type: 'tabpanel',
  tabs: [ // array of tab panel specifications
    {
      name: 'mytab',
      title: 'My Tab',
      items: [ ... ] // array of panel components
    },
    ...
  ]
}
----

The `+name+` of the panel can be used with the link:{baseurl}/how-to-guides/creating-custom-ui-components/dialogs/dialog-apis/#dialogapimethods[`+dialogApi.showTab('tabName')+`] method to programmatically switch tabs. It is also passed to link:{baseurl}/how-to-guides/creating-custom-ui-components/dialogs/dialog-configuration/#configurationoptions[`+onTabChange+`] as part of the `+details+` object.

==== Example tab panel

The Help plugin's dialog is an example of a tab panel dialog.
