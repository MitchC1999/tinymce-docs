\{% assign pluginname = "Export" %} \{% assign plugincode = "export" %} \{% include /misc/admon_premium_plugin.md %}

The \{\{pluginname}} plugin adds the ability to export content from the editor to a user's local machine in various formats. For a list of available exporters and information on what they support, see the link:#exporters[Exporters section].

== Interactive example

To export the editor content, either:

* From the _File_ menu, click _Export_ and select _PDF_.
* Click the Export toolbar button (image:{{site.baseurl}}/images/icons/export.svg[Export icon: A page with an arrow from the center of the page to the right of the page]) and select _PDF_.

\{% include live-demo.html id="export" %}

\{% assign pluginminimumplan = 'tiertwo' %} \{% include misc/purchase-premium-plugins.md %}

== Basic setup

To add the \{\{pluginname}} plugin to the editor, add `+{{plugincode}}+` to the `+plugins+` option in the editor configuration.

For example:

[source,js]
----
tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea',  // change this value according to your HTML
  plugins: '{{plugincode}}',
  toolbar: 'export',
  export_image_proxy: 'proxy.php' // Required for rendering remote images
});
----

== Exporters

The \{\{pluginname}} plugin provides the following exporters:

* link:#client-sidepdfclientpdf[Client-side PDF (`+clientpdf+`)]

=== Client-side PDF (`+clientpdf+`)

The client-side PDF exporter converts the editor content to a PDF without the need for server-side components. This exporter will resize the content to fit on A4 pages, add page breaks, take a snapshot of the HTML, and embed the snapshot image within the exported PDF.

This exporter has a few limitations or known issues that should be noted:

* The text content in the PDF cannot be selected or copied.
* A single line of content sliced horizontally and distributed across separate pages.
* Due to browser limitations, there is a limit on the number of pages that can be rendered. The number of pages varies between browsers.
* Remote images require an image proxy to render due to browser limitations. For information on proxying remote images, see the link:#export_image_proxy[export_image_proxy] option.
* Right-to-left languages that use cursive scripts (such as Arabic) may not render correctly due to an issue with how the image of the HTML content is rendered.
* The link:{{site.baseurl}}/plugins-ref/premium/checklist/[Checklist plugin] icons will not render for Internet Explorer 11 users due to browser limitations.
