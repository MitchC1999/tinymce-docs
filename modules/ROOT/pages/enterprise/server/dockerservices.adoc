The {{site.enterpriseversion}} server-side components can be deployed on Docker orchestration applications such as https://kubernetes.io/[Kubernetes], https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/[Docker Swarm], or https://www.openshift.com/[OpenShift]. {{site.companyname}} provides packages containing pre-configured https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/[`Dockerfiles`] for building and deploying the {{site.enterpriseversion}} server-side components using Docker.

== Containerized services for Self-hosted Enterprise deployments

The following sections assist with containerizing the {{ site.productname }} services for users with licenses to the Self-hosted {{site.productname}} Enterprise bundles:

* The *Self-hosted Essential* bundle.
* The *Self-hosted Professional* bundle.
* The *Self-hosted Premium* bundle.

=== Prerequisites

* The https://docs.docker.com/engine/docker-overview/[Docker Engine] is installed and running.
* The user has Administrative or Root user access.
* The user is either:
 ** Using a Linux, Unix or macOS operating system.
 ** Using Windows and has access to unix command line tools using https://gitforwindows.org/[Git for Windows], https://www.cygwin.com/[Cygwin], or the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10[Windows Subsystem for Linux].

=== Download and extract the TinyMCE Self-hosted Bundle

. Go to *link:{{site.download-enterprise}}[{{site.accountpage}} Downloads]* and download the {{site.productname}} self-hosted bundle `.zip` file.
. Open a command line and navigate to the directory containing the downloaded `.zip` file:
 ** `TinyMCE-Essential_latest.zip` for *Self-hosted Essential* users.
 ** `TinyMCE-Professional_latest.zip` for *Self-hosted Professional* users.
 ** `TinyMCE-Premium_latest.zip` for *Self-hosted Premium* users.

+
Windows Users should open a Bash command line as the Administrator User.
. Extract the contents of the `.zip` file, such as:
+
`sh
 unzip TinyMCE-Premium_latest.zip -d tinymce-selfhosted
`
+
The structure of the extracted files will be:
+
`sh
 tinymce-selfhosted/
 ├── tinymce/
 └── tinymce-services/
     ├── ephox-hyperlinking-docker-starter-kit.zip
     ├── ephox-hyperlinking.war
     ├── ephox-image-proxy-docker-starter-kit.zip
     ├── ephox-image-proxy.war
     ├── ephox-spelling-docker-starter-kit.zip
     ├── ephox-spelling.war
     └── version.txt
`

. Navigate into the `tinymce-services` folder.
+
`sh
 cd tinymce-selfhosted/tinymce-services/
`
