= Introduction and initial setup for containerized server-side services from the premium self-hosted bundle

:title_nav: Introduction and initial setup :description: The containerized server-side components for premium plugins.

The \{\{site.enterpriseversion}} server-side components can be deployed on Docker orchestration applications such as https://kubernetes.io/[Kubernetes], https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/[Docker Swarm], or https://www.openshift.com/[OpenShift]. \{\{site.companyname}} provides packages containing pre-configured https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/[`+Dockerfiles+`] for building and deploying the \{\{site.enterpriseversion}} server-side components using Docker.

== Containerized services for Self-hosted Enterprise deployments

The following sections assist with containerizing the \{\{ site.productname }} services for users with licenses to the Self-hosted \{\{site.productname}} Enterprise bundles:

* The *Self-hosted Essential* bundle.
* The *Self-hosted Professional* bundle.
* The *Self-hosted Premium* bundle.

=== Prerequisites

* The https://docs.docker.com/engine/docker-overview/[Docker Engine] is installed and running.
* The user has Administrative or Root user access.
* The user is either:
** Using a Linux, Unix or macOS operating system.
** Using Windows and has access to unix command line tools using https://gitforwindows.org/[Git for Windows], https://www.cygwin.com/[Cygwin], or the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10[Windows Subsystem for Linux].

=== Download and extract the TinyMCE Self-hosted Bundle

[arabic]
. Go to *link:{{site.download-enterprise}}[\{\{site.accountpage}} Downloads]* and download the \{\{site.productname}} self-hosted bundle `+.zip+` file.
. Open a command line and navigate to the directory containing the downloaded `+.zip+` file:
* `+TinyMCE-Essential_latest.zip+` for *Self-hosted Essential* users.
* `+TinyMCE-Professional_latest.zip+` for *Self-hosted Professional* users.
* `+TinyMCE-Premium_latest.zip+` for *Self-hosted Premium* users.
+
Windows Users should open a Bash command line as the Administrator User.
. Extract the contents of the `+.zip+` file, such as:
+
[source,sh]
----
unzip TinyMCE-Premium_latest.zip -d tinymce-selfhosted
----
+
The structure of the extracted files will be:
+
[source,sh]
----
tinymce-selfhosted/
├── tinymce/
└── tinymce-services/
    ├── ephox-hyperlinking-docker-starter-kit.zip
    ├── ephox-hyperlinking.war
    ├── ephox-image-proxy-docker-starter-kit.zip
    ├── ephox-image-proxy.war
    ├── ephox-spelling-docker-starter-kit.zip
    ├── ephox-spelling.war
    └── version.txt

. Navigate into the `+tinymce-services+` folder.

[source,sh]
----
cd tinymce-selfhosted/tinymce-services/
