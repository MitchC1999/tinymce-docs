== Enhancements

The following enhancements were made for the \{\{site.productname}} 6.0 release.

=== `+tabindex+` improvement

In iframe (classic editor) mode, \{\{site.productname}} now copies the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/tabindex[`+tabindex+` attribute] from the target element to the editor's iframe. This accessibility improvement allows integrators to rely on the browser behavior for specifying tab order, instead of specially configuring \{\{site.productname}}. It also replaces the link:#tabfocusplugin[Tabfocus plugin].
