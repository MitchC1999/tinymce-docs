:title_nav: TinyMCE for mobile

:description: The TinyMCE rich text editing experience for mobile devices.
:keywords: mobile tablet

The mobile experience for {productname} is enabled by default and has the following differences when compared to the "desktop" experience:

* Horizontal contextual menus on mobile.
* Side-scrolling toolbars and contextual menus on mobile.
* Contextual keyboard settings for dialogs using link:dialog-components.html#inputmode[`+inputMode+`].
* <<mobiledefaultsforselectedsettings, Mobile defaults for selected settings>>.

The mobile experience allows most of the {productname} plugins to work on mobile devices, except for:

* link:comments.html[Comments].
* link:imagetools.html[Image tools].
* link:moxiemanager.html[MoxieManager].
* link:permanentpen.html[Permanent Pen].

{productname} will detect the platform and show an optimal UI experience based on the device type and screen size.

____
*Note*: iPads do not use the `+mobile+` part of the {productname} init configuration. This is due to a constraint added by Apple to return the environment as a "desktop environment" for iPads. iPad users will receive the other changes to touch functionality, such as context toolbars and context menus.

== Configuring mobile

Add the following `+meta+` tag to the `+head+` of pages using {productname} to ensure the mobile user interface functions as intended.

[source,html]

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

To set mobile specific options, add the option to <<themobileoption, the `+mobile+` option>> configuration, such as:

[source,js]
----
tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea',
  mobile: {
    menubar: true
  }
});
