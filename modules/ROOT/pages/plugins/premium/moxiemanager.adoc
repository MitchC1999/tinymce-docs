MoxieManager is a premium {{site.productname}} plugin and server system that enables users to insert files located externally to the editor (e.g. on their client desktop) into their document.

MoxieManager is an application separate from {{site.productname}} that includes .NET or PHP server components. Being built by the team behind {{site.productname}} it has tight integration with the editor via a toolbar control. It is designed to work with {{site.productname}} configuration settings such as `relative_urls`.

MoxieManager is a paid addition to {{site.productname}}. It is included in link:{{site.pricingpage}}[{\{enterpriseversion}} subscriptions].

Full documentation on MoxieManager, including how to http://www.moxiemanager.com/documentation/index.php/TinyMCE_Integration[integrate with {{site.productname}}], can be http://www.moxiemanager.com/documentation/[found] on the MoxieManager website.
