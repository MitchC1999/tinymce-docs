{cloudname} is the easiest way to integrate {productname} and upgrade to premium plugins.

{cloudname} can be used without an API key. Sign up for an API key and update the script tag to use premium plugins or avoid the in-editor developer warning.

All {cloudname} accounts include a free, pre-configured {cloudname} image proxy service. This setup uses the link:imagetools.html[Image tools] plugin.

== Integrating TinyMCE for the first time

=== Step 1: Insert the Tiny Cloud script tag into the webpage

Insert the {productname} editor code into the application to load {productname} for the first time. The code inserting is done by adding the following script tag into your app, or in the case of a web page the `+<head>+` of the page:

The following example adds a script tag into the application that inserts the code. Use the `+<head>+` of the page on a web page. Be sure to substitute 'no-api-key' with your api key.

[source,html]
----
<script src="{cdnurl}" referrerpolicy="origin"></script>
----

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|===
| |Value |Description
|1 |no-api-key |Replace with your api key
|2 |origin= |A `+referrerpolicy+` specifies how much of the current page's URL is sent in the `+Referer+` header when the browser fetches page resources (for example, the {productname} editor). The use of the `+Referer+` header ensures API keys are only used on domains registered to their owners. We only care about the domain portion however (similar to the operation of `+Origin+` header), so for improved performance and privacy always set the `+referrerpolicy+` to `+origin+` when requesting {cloudname} resources.

____
*Important*: {cloudname} verifies the domain {productname} is loading from by checking the *Referer* header in the network request. Sometimes the domains in the *Referer* header does not match with the URL in the browser's address bar.

To check the *Referer* header, open your browser's _Developer's Tools_ and open the _Network_ tab. From there, find the request being made to load {productname} with your API key, and click on the *Headers* tab. In the section called *Request Headers* there should be a field for *Referer*. If the value there is different from one of your registered URLs, you may need to adjust either your registered URLs, or your application's *Refer* header settings.
____

=== Step 2: Load, customize and interact with TinyMCE

There are more than 40 open source plugins that enhance the editing experience in addition to the advanced content create solutions on {cloudname}. A range of link:/demos/basic-example/[simple examples] are available. Refer to the link:/getting-started/install-setup/cloud/cloud-quick-start/[Quick start] section for more information.

=== Step 3: Specifying purchased TinyMCE plugins and toolbar/menu items

Extend the link:/how-to-guides/learn-the-basics/basic-setup/[{productname} configuration] to include any additional purchased plugins and associated toolbar and menu items. Refer to the following enablement guides for more information:

* link:mentions.html[Mentions]
* link:/plugins-ref/premium/tinydrive/[{cloudfilemanager}]
* link:comments.html[Comments]
* link:pageembed.html[Page Embed]
* link:permanentpen.html[Permanent Pen]
* link:formatpainter.html[Format Painter]
* link:powerpaste.html[PowerPaste]
* link:tinymcespellchecker.html[Spell Checker Pro]

____
*Note*: `+spellchecker_rpc_url+` is *not* required when enabling this plugin via link:/how-to-guides/cloud-deployment-guide/[{cloudname}].
____

* link:imagetools.html[Image Tools (with configured image proxy)]

____
*Note*: Configuration of the `+imagetools_cors_hosts+` and `+imagetools_proxy+` properties occurs automatically.

* link:moxiemanager.html[Moxie Manager]
* link:a11ychecker.html[Accessibility Checker]
* link:advcode.html[Advanced Code Editor]
* link:mediaembed.html[Enhanced Media Embed]
* link:linkchecker.html[Link Checker]

____
*Note*: It may take up to 30 minutes for the purchased plugin to be available to {productname}. Clear the browser's cache.
____

=== Step 4: Forward proxy configuration

Ensure that the following URLs are accessible via this proxy if the network has a forward proxy that controls access to the internet.

* All URLs where the editor is deployed.
* All URLs where the plugins are deployed.
* https://imageproxy.tiny.cloud
* https://hyperlinking.tiny.cloud
* https://spelling.tiny.cloud

Ensure the `+tiny-api-key+` and `+tinymce-api-key+` headers are retained while requesting the list of above URLs.

=== Step 5: Specifying a translation

To change the user interface language with a language pack, use the link:ui-localization.html#language[language configuration option].

Alternatively, link:ui-localization.html#language_url[Specify its location] with the `+language_url+` configuration option.

== Migrating from a self-hosted environment to Tiny Cloud

[[step-1-replace-existing-reference-to-tinymceminjs]]
=== Step 1: Replace existing reference to tinymce.min.js

Migrating from a self-hosted environment to {cloudname} is easy. Remove the existing script tag that loads {productname}â€™s JavaScript.

____
*Note*: The script tag typically references `+tinymce.min.js+` hosted within the application or available at a legacy CDN.
____

Replace the script tag with the following:

[source,html]
----
<script src="{cdnurl}" referrerpolicy="origin"></script>
----

=== Step 2: Update custom plugin paths

Reference link:editor-important-options.html#external_plugins[external_plugins] to ensure custom plugins or modified plugins continue to function in the {cloudname} deployment.

____
*Warning*: Do not use the regular link:/how-to-guides/learn-the-basics/work-with-plugins/[plugins] configuration element.
____

=== Step 3: Specify purchased TinyMCE plugins and toolbar buttons

Extend the link:/how-to-guides/learn-the-basics/basic-setup/[{productname} configuration] to include any additional purchased plugins and associated toolbar and menu items. Refer to the following enablement guides for more information:

* link:mentions.html[Mentions]
* link:/plugins-ref/premium/tinydrive/[{cloudfilemanager}]
