== Prerequisites

* A {{site.cloudname}} API key from link:{{site.accountsignup}}[{{site.accountpage}}].
* A JWT key generated at link:{{site.accountpageurl}}[{{site.accountpageurl}}]. Temporarily store the generated keys for use in the following procedure.

{{site.cloudfilemanager}} allows trouble free management of assets such as images and files in the cloud. {{site.cloudfilemanager}} is only available in link:{{site.accountsignup}}[{{site.cloudname}}] and requires registering for an API key.

To enable this functionality in the {{site.productname}} editor, add `tinydrive` to the list of plugins in the `tinymce.init` call. The user also needs to be authenticated using a link:{{site.baseurl}}/tinydrive/jwt-authentication/[JSON Web Token (JWT)].

Once {{site.cloudfilemanager}} is enabled, it integrates as the default file picker for the Image, Link, and Media dialogs and as the default upload handler for local images being pasted or inserted into the document.
