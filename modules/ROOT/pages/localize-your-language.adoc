= Localize TinyMCE

:title_nav: Localization :description: Localize TinyMCE with global language capabilities. :keywords: internationalization localization languages

\{\{site.productname}} makes your project accessible to the world through its simple localization framework.

This section demonstrates how to change \{\{site.productname}}'s user interface to the user's language preference. These settings change the language in the toolbar, menu items, buttons, and tooltips.

____
*Note*: Language settings can be controlled in these configuration options: [directionality](\{\{ site.baseurl }}/content/content-localization/#directionality), [language](\{\{ site.baseurl }}/interface/ui-localization/#language) and [language_url](\{\{ site.baseurl }}/interface/ui-localization/#language_url). There is also a link:{{site.baseurl}}/plugins-ref/opensource/directionality/[Directionality plugin] that adds a toolbar button to control `+ltr-rtl+` behavior.
____

== Step 1

Go to the link:{{site.gettiny}}/language-packages/[language download page] to review a list of language packs available for \{\{site.productname}}.

Click the download link on the far right of the table for a single language. Check the box beside each language and then click the download button at the bottom of the table for multiple languages.

____
*Important*: The \{\{site.productname}} community translation project provides the language packs on our language download page.
____

== Step 2

Unpack the language `+js+` file(s) into the `+path/to/tinymce/langs/+` folder.

____
*Important*: The language settings will not work unless the language pack is placed in `+langs/+` directory. The [language_url](\{\{ site.baseurl }}/interface/ui-localization/#language_url) configuration option is another method to enable additional language settings.
____

== Step 3

Set the language option in \{\{site.productname}}'s configuration to the language code in the list on [this page](\{\{ site.baseurl }}/interface/ui-localization/#language).

== Step 4

Load \{\{site.productname}} to confirm that the language is set correctly.

== A working example

The following code snippet sets \{\{site.productname}}'s language to Chinese and the text directionality from right to left.

link:{{site.gettiny}}/language-packages/[Download the Chinese language] pack to test this functionality. Install a _local instance_ of \{\{site.productname}} from the link:{{site.gettiny}}/[downloads page]. Follow the [self-hosted install instructions](\{\{ site.baseurl }}/getting-started/install-setup/self-hosted/expressjs/).
