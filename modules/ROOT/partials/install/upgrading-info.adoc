+
`sh
 tinymce/
 ├── icons/
 ├── langs/
 ├── plugins/
 ├── skins/
 │   ├── content/
 │   └── ui/
 └── themes/
`

. Download the latest version of {{site.productname}}.
 ** For the {{site.productname}} Community Version, download `{{site.prodnamecode}}_<VERSION>.zip` from link:{{site.gettiny}}/self-hosted/[Get {{site.productname}} - Self-hosted releases], where _`<VERSION>`_ is the latest version of {{site.productname}}.
 ** For the {{site.productname}} Enterprise Version, download the *{{site.productname}} Enterprise Bundle* from link:{{site.accountpageurl}}/downloads/[{{site.accountpage}} > Downloads]. The downloaded file will be named `enterprise_latest.zip`.

 ** Custom themes
. Delete the existing `{{site.prodnamecode}}/` directory and replace with the new `{{site.prodnamecode}}/`.
