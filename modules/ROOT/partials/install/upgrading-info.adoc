│   └── ui/
└── themes/
----
. Download the latest version of \{\{site.productname}}.
* For the \{\{site.productname}} Community Version, download `+{prodnamecode}_<VERSION>.zip+` from link:{gettiny}/self-hosted/[Get \{\{site.productname}} - Self-hosted releases], where _`+<VERSION>+`_ is the latest version of \{\{site.productname}}.
