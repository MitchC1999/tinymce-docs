+
[source,sh]
----
tinymce/
├── icons/
├── langs/
├── plugins/
├── skins/
│   ├── content/
│   └── ui/
└── themes/
----
. Download the latest version of {productname}.
* For the {productname} Community Version, download `+{prodnamecode}_<VERSION>.zip+` from link:{gettiny}/self-hosted/[Get {productname} - Self-hosted releases], where _`+<VERSION>+`_ is the latest version of {productname}.
* For the {productname} Enterprise Version, download the *{productname} Enterprise Bundle* from link:{accountpageurl}/downloads/[{accountpage} > Downloads]. The downloaded file will be named `+enterprise_latest.zip+`.
. Extract the downloaded `+.zip+` file to a temporary location.
. (If required) Install the latest language packs from link:{gettiny}/language-packages/[Get {productname} - Language Packages].

* Custom themes
. Delete the existing `+{prodnamecode}/+` directory and replace with the new `+{prodnamecode}/+`.
