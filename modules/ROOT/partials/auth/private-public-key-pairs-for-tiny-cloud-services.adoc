The {\{pluginname}} Server requires a _public_ key generated from the same _private_ key that will be used on your JSON Web Token (JWT) provider endpoint. The public key(s) stored on the {\{pluginname}} Server are used to ensure that content is sent by authorized users.

There are two methods for generating and adding a public key to your API key:

. The secure key pair generator at link:{{site.accountpageurl}}/jwt/[{{site.accountpage}} - JWT Keys] (recommended).
. Generate a key pair locally and add the _public_ key to link:{{site.accountpageurl}}/jwt/[{{site.accountpage}} - JWT Keys].

=== Generate a key pair using the {{site.accountpage}} JWT Keys page

The link:{{site.accountpageurl}}/jwt/[{{site.accountpage}} - JWT Keys] page provides a private/public key generator, providing a quick and secure way of generating the required keys. This generator will store a copy of the _public_ key, and provide a downloadable file for both the public and private keys. {{site.companyname}} does not store the _private_ key and the key pair cannot be retrieved later.

=== Generate a key pair locally

When generating a key pair locally, use one of the supported algorithms.
{% include auth/jwt-supported-algorithms.md %}

For instructions on generating a key pair locally, see: link:{{site.baseurl}}/advanced/generate-rsa-key-pairs/[Creating a private/public key pair for Tiny Cloud].

Once a public key has been generated, add the public key to the {{site.cloudname}} API key at: link:{{site.accountpageurl}}/jwt/[{{site.accountpage}} - JWT Keys].
