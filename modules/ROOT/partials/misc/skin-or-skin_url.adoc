There are two options for applying a skin to {productname}: `+skin+` and `+skin_url+`. {companyname} recommends using the `+skin+` option for skins bundled with the product or included in your cloud subscription. Custom or third-party skins should be included using the `+skin_url+` option to simplify updating and upgrading {productname}.
