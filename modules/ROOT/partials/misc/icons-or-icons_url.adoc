There are two options for replacing the icons in {productname}: `+icons+` and `+icons_url+`. {companyname} recommends using the `+icons+` option for icon packs bundled with the product or included in your cloud subscription. Custom or third-party icons should be included using the `+icons_url+` option to simplify updating and upgrading {productname}.
