There are two options for adding plugins to {productname}: `+plugins+` and `+external_plugins+`. {companyname} recommends using the `+plugins+` option for plugins bundled with the product or included in your cloud subscription. Custom or third-party plugins should be included using the `+external_plugins+` option to simplify updating and upgrading {productname}.
