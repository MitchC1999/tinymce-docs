There are two options for changing the language of the {productname} user interfaces: `+language+` and `+language_url+`. {companyname} recommends using the `+language+` option for language packs bundled with the product or included in your cloud subscription. Community translations, custom language pack, or third-party language packs should be included using the `+language_url+` option to simplify updating and upgrading {productname}.
