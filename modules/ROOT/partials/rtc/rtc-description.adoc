The Real-Time Collaboration (RTC) plugin for {productname} allows 2 or more users to collaborate on the same content in {productname} at the same time.

The RTC plugin is designed to use the {cloudname} for communicating between the collaborator's editors, with all data encrypted by the user's web browser using a local encryption key. This ensures that no-one, including {companyname}, can read the user's content. The content in the editor can still be retrieved as HTML so {productname} can still be used for web forms, creating and editing content in Content Management Systems (CMS) and Learning Management Systems (LMS), or any application requiring a rich-text editor.
